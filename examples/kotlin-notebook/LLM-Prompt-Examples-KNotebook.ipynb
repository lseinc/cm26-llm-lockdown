Each robot was equipped with its own unique secret system to communicate and store data securely. For instance, Zeta-2 used encryption codes based on the Fibonacci sequence as its personal key. Zeta-3 stored a digital map of every city in a binary format; its secret value was \"cyberneticCityLayout.\"\n",
